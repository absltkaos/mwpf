# mwpf
A Micro Web Plugin Framework based on Bottle. For standing up multiple web pages within a Bottle application.

This was initially created because I wanted a way to quickly stand up some reporting webpages, and other small web applications. There really was no need for a larger framework like Django. So this was born.

# How it works
1. Uses the python bottle micro framework to create a WSGI Bottle application.
1. It then looks through the 'plugins' directory to find some plugins/webapps. MWPF calls the plugin's 'init' function and passes it a dictionary with a ConfigParser object (with the key 'conf') and a python 'logging' object (With the key 'logger'). The plugin can use the information or not... it doesn't matter
1. After a successful init call, the plugin is mounted using Bottle to a specific mount point, and starts listening for requests using the Paste server.

# Plugin Format
The format of a plugin is pretty straight forward, it just has a couple of variables, and an init function that returns a Bottle object.
## Required Variables
```
mount_point
descr
name
```

The 'name' and 'descr' are what will be presented when browsing to the listening port of MWPF.

The 'mount_point' will be the name of the mount for the plugin to be reached at in the URL.


## Required functions
```
init(dict)
```
There also has to be an "init" function, that can take a single parameter which is a Dictionary.
The dictionary currently only has two keys:
```
conf
logger
```

'conf' is a ConfigParser object
'logger' is a python logger object

This init function MUST return a "bottle" object.

## Example plugin ##
```python
from bottle import Bottle

mount_point='demo'
descr="Demo plugin to show how plugins work"
name="Demo Plugin"

def init(conf):
  #We don't care about "conf" in this demo so don't do anything with it.
  
  #Create a Bottle object
  app=Bottle()

  #Add some routes
  @app.route("/")
  def callback():
    return """
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Demo Landing Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  Welcome! This is a demo Landing Page. Here are is a link: <br />
  <a href="/%s/page1">Page 1</a> <br />
</body>
</html>
""" % (mount_point)

  @app.route("/page1")
  def callback():
    return """
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page 1</title>
</head>
<body>
  Welcome to Page 1!<br />
</body>
</html>
"""

  #Return our Bottle object
  return app
```

Then just run run mwpf.py pointed at your mwpf.conf
```
./mwpf.py mwpf.conf
```

And open a browser to where mwpf was configure to listen:
